### Continuous Testing

**On Every Commit**
- Run unit tests
- Run linting
- Run type checking

**On Pull Request**
- Run unit tests
- Run integration tests
- Run security scan (Snyk)
- Check code coverage (must not decrease)

**Before Deployment**
- Run full test suite
- Run E2E tests on staging
- Run smoke tests on production (post-deploy)

## 7. Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Blockchain network congestion** | Medium | High | Implement dynamic gas pricing, queue system, fallback to alternate chain |
| **Payment gateway downtime** | Low | High | Integrate multiple gateways, implement fallback, cache responses |
| **Database performance issues** | Medium | High | Implement proper indexing, read replicas, caching, query optimization |
| **Security breach** | Low | Critical | Regular security audits, penetration testing, bug bounty program |
| **Exchange rate API failure** | Medium | Medium | Multiple API providers, caching, rate limiting |
| **Third-party KYC provider issues** | Low | Medium | Backup provider, manual review process |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Regulatory compliance issues** | Medium | Critical | Legal consultation, compliance officer, regular audits |
| **Low user adoption** | Medium | High | Marketing campaign, referral program, user education |
| **High transaction fees** | Medium | Medium | Negotiate rates, optimize blockchain usage, subsidize initially |
| **Fraud and chargebacks** | Medium | High | Robust fraud detection, KYC verification, transaction limits |

### Operational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Team member leaves** | Medium | Medium | Knowledge documentation, pair programming, code reviews |
| **Scope creep** | High | Medium | Strict sprint planning, change control process, stakeholder alignment |
| **Infrastructure costs** | Medium | Medium | Cost monitoring, usage optimization, reserved instances |
| **App store rejection** | Low | High | Follow guidelines strictly, prepare for appeals, have web fallback |
